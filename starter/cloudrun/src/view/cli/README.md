# CLI

Cli tool to operate scripts that can use internal services or to add development toolkit with the same interface and usage. Currently cli tool is operated using tsx tool.

## üë∑ Development

The CLI tool is build around `yargs` library. Each command needs its own `ts` file in current folder or in subfolder. The entrypoint `Cli.ts` scans the sub folders for `ts` files and intrerprets them as a command under the module called same as the folder.

For example, current [openapi folder](./openapi) creates a new module `openapi` and assigns a new command called `generate` based on contents in [generate.ts](./openapi/generate.ts) file.

Each command should export only functions and variables according to `CommandDefinition` in [cli.ts file](./cli.ts).

Take a look at the [generate.ts](./openapi/generate.ts) for example how to implement own command.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage in production scripts

If the cli tool is used to run production scripts (CRON), make sure all dependencies are also listed in production list and build the code instead of using `tsx` (e.g. `yargs`).
